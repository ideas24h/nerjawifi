      This is a really useful little device and was used everyday while I had it on hire.I didnâ€™t have have sat nat in my hire car so being able to use my I pad or phone without having to turn on data roaming to map read was a real bonus. I used 3 pieces of equipment and had no problems, I would recommend this device even after data roaming charges have been reduced.
